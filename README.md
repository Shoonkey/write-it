# Write It

This is Write It, a note taking app I built for venting to oneself. To write things you wanna toss into the world and forget about.

This app saves everything locally on your device; it's simply a blank slate where you can write thoughts down, think about them and let them go. It uses the LocalStorage API and you're encouraged to move it somewhere else and delete it from the app after you write stuff down.
